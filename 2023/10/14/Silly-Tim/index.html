        <p>There are various kinds of silly. There was a boy named Timothy who was a different kind of silly. You tell him Apples are Red and he might just say there is a yard of magic apple trees owned by an evil witch on the edge of the cliff where red apples grow. Now there isn’t much you can do about people like Timothy. You cannot take responsibility either. You can just let them be and navigate life using their own twisted words. </p>
<p>Timothy would usually imagine something that would have no close relationship to the reality. The next step would be mixing up the imagination with something someone said and then blabbering that to the third person.</p>
<p>That morning Timothy was thinking about skates. As he stepped out of the house he met a fine gentleman who was trying to find his way to the market. He was new to the town and just exploring. The poor man had just found the wrong guy to explain the way to him. It took Timothy a whole 20 minutes to finish the story he had spun which included skating on roads in the hilly areas and how it is very easy to crush a carrot with a skate if you happen to drop it.</p>
<p>The gentleman had his mouth wide open by the time Timothy was done. He was incredibly confused and thought he shouldn’t explore the market that day at all. It was just in time that Timothy’s mother stepped out and apologised to the fine man for his wasted time. She pointed him to the road straight ahead and asked him to take the second left. The man thanked his mother and went on his way. While Timothy was dragged by the ear inside the house and given a good round of hearing. Well Timothy being Timothy will find another story to spin on another fine day no matter how stretched his ears get by all that pulling.</p>
