        <p>Tipsy was sitting by the pond with his fishing rod and humming his favourite tune. As far as the entire community of gnomes went one could say Tipsy was one of a cool temperament. Tipsy kept thinking if he managed to catch a big fish today he would invite the neighbours over for dinner.<br>Anyone who knew Tipsy also knew how he loved dreaming. It didnâ€™t matter if he was sleeping or awake, he would get lost in dreams in no time.<br>It was a beautiful sunny day and by the pond Tipsy had made himself real comfortable. He had his snacks, a good book to read if he needed to and a soft comfortable pillow so that he could sit on that chair for a long time. After a bit of snacking and reading he dozed off in no time.<br>Now Tipsy finds himself in a little cottage situated at the corner of a large field. The little cottage was comfortable and cozy. It had a warm comfortable bed. There was the smell of freshly cooked rice in the kitchen. A nice fireplace infront of a comfortable couch that had nice pillows and a comforter spread out. On the table along the couch was a cup of warm coffee and snacks. On the side was his favourite book of stories.<br>With a broad smile on his face Tipsy walks out of the cottage to find a nice lounge chair in the little lawn. The grass under his feet felt soft. In the large field was a small patch of the land to just spread out for a nice little picnic. On one side of the patch was a bed of flowers that whose fragrance the wind carried. On the other side were large trees that provided shade to rest under. Tipsy laid out a broad sheet under the shade of the trees and laid down in pure bliss with his favourite book and some snacks. The sun made the weather warm and the trees provided cool shade. It was as perfect as it gets.<br>He suddenly wakes up by a pull and that was when he realised it was the fishing rod. He starts to draw it in and indeed that was a fish bigger than he hoped to catch.<br>It was a rather good wake up call to a rather beautiful dream.<br>Tipsy pretty much danced his way back to home that evening. If anyone was having a good day it was definitely Tipsy. </p>
