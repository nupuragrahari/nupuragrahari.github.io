        <p>Candy was particularly irritated and annoyed that day.  And there wasn’t one person she could think of to say her piece to. She had been long planning to visit a cousin of hers. And she wanted to go alone share some quiet days, have heart to heart conversations, enjoy food and drink and maybe even go on a drive.<br>While she had all of this plan in her head and she told her brothers that she was planning to go they insisted to come along to. Now this ruins everything. She would not be just spending extra pennies, there will be extra chaos. There will be too much talk and the mood she is in all the extra talk is gonna make her mad very easily.<br>Most days her brothers would drive her crazy to a point where she would want to run off to an island and never come back. The mind does tend to think like that in anger, sweet escape.<br>Well it was a bright Sunday and they did head off for cousin get together. The Sun was warm and the road was beautiful but Candy was barely enjoying all that given the blaring music that was playing in her car. She turned it off multiple times but eventually got tired and gave in.<br>They reached and Annie ran towards her and gave her the longest hug. That certainly helped. Candy would never stop saying how Annie gives the best, warmest and the most cozy hugs.<br>“I have the perfect day planned on the beach for us! We have got a ton of lemonade, cookies and a wonderful collection of books to pick from. We are gonna just lay there, drink and eat, read a bit, have long chats and dose off right there.”<br>Annie was moving at super-human speed while she was saying all that. She was preparing baskets, getting beach towels and all sorts of stuff.<br>Candy looked at his brothers pushing each other in the mud outside and wondered how was any of dear Annie’s plans going to fall in place.<br>The four of them reach the beach anyway. Everyone picks out a cookie and a bottle of lemonade. Annie and Candy neatly lay down their towels to lie down and as the boys were insisting for them to get into the water a ball hit one of the boy’s head.<br>There were a group of boys playing football not far away. Now Annie was worried that there was going to be a fight and she kept looking in the direction of all of these boys talking. The ball was still in her brother’s hand.<br>It had been a few minutes and they tell the girls they are gonna go play football with the rest of the boys.<br>Candy gets her peace time anyway! She tried a little too hard to hide the smile on her face until the boys get away. As soon as they did Candy and Annie let out a little squeal. They took a sip of the cool lemonade and got straight to chatting. They had so much to talk about they never even got to the books. The day passed in bliss and they ended up seeing the sunset together and cherishing the moments together.
