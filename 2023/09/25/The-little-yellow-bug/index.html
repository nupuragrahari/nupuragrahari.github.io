        <p>In a family of ladybugs that lived under a mushroom, a small little yellow ladybug took birth. She would often fall when trying to fly. The other little ladybugs had already started flying some distance. This little ladybug was told often that something is wrong with her. But she did wanted to prove others wrong so she kept moving while also believing something was wrong with her. She did eventually fly some distance but the thought that something was wrong with her didn’t escape the mind. She went on her life with the same thought. Constantly afraid before attempting anything that this would be harder for her than it is for others. She would make her way and move forward in life but the thought never escaped. Fear took root in some years. And the battle grew. Now it was the thought that she was not enough and the fear of her not being enough.<br>On a usual sunny day she saw one of the flying champions of the ladybug community fall again and again. She went and enquired about the situation. She saw that the vision of this ladybug was being blurred by something that was stuck on her one eye. And this ladybug was thinking that she had lost her flying capabilities.<br>The yellow ladybug smiled to herself and flew off.<br>Sometimes it is the people around you that put thoughts in your head and sometimes it is just you who kept believing things about yourself. Although many of us realise that it’s not easy to change the thought that has been stuck in your head for years. But we can pause and quickly re think every time our brain says that we did something wrong. Maybe just one day we would have overwritten all the pain we have been giving ourselves. </p>
